>__About the NGO:__
Coimbatore Smiley Project is a registered NGO founded and run by students 
for the purpose of educating less fortunate children. We believe that education 
is the best gift for the children as it gives them the freedom and the ability to 
stand up for themselves. Who else can help them out in education more than us students? 
With this simple goal in mind, students from various colleges in the city of Coimbatore 
have come together to utilize our strengths to head this organization for sharing the best 
resource in the world â€“ education.
